# R-markdown presentation
This project demonstrates how R-markdown helps create a beautiful presentation.

In this report, I discussed one of the libraries in R, called Tidyquant, which is helpful for financial analysis.

## Benefits of Working with Tidyquant Library
Bringing business and financial analysis to the 'tidyverse'. 
The 'tidyquant' package provides a convenient wrapper to various 'xts', 'zoo', 'quantmod', 'TTR' and 'PerformanceAnalytics' package functions and returns the objects in the tidy 'tibble' format. 
The main advantage is being able to use quantitative functions with the 'tidyverse' functions including 'purrr', 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'ggplot2', 'lubridate', etc. 

### Note
I used revealjs which is a RMarkdown library that must be installed  (based on the JavaScript library for HTML presentations reveal.js)
There is some good documentation for reveal.js markdown [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/revealjs.html)
